Did a Challenge Found on a Reddit Subtopic.

The goal was to properly give a number a value of either 0, or 1, based on it's binary value.
If the Binary contained an odd sequence of 0's, the value would be set and displayed as 0.
If the Binary vontained no odd sequences of 0's the value would be set and displayed as 1.

Also, I have the Javascript search for any instances of 0's and style them to a different font-color.
